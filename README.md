## About
Scdlang (pronounced `/ˈesˌsi:ˈdi:ˈlæŋ/`) is a description language for describing Statecharts that later can be used to generate code or just transpile it into another format. This project is more focus on how to describe Statecharts universally that can be used in another language/platform rather than drawing a Statecharts diagram. For drawing, see [State Machine Cat][].

![quick_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4953069/60861162-a5d1a800-a243-11e9-8dd3-b04ee3fde30c.gif)

### Philosophy
- **Readable** just like you read then visualize a state diagram
- **Writeable** just like you write code which is concise, clear, and can be refactored
- **Transferable** to any implementation (e.g platform, programming language, runtime, etc)

### Key Features
- [x] Awesome CLI (see [usage](packages/cli/README.md))
- [x] Syntax is inspired from various drawing languages like [mermaid][], [Graphviz][], [PlantUML][], and many more
- [x] Decent error message
- [x] Avoid invalid and ambigous transition via semantics analysis
- Transpile into other formats:
  - [x] [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/)
  - [x] [State Machine Cat][]
  - [ ] [Kingly](https://brucou.github.io/documentation/)
  - [ ] [CSV](https://github.com/DrSensor/scdlang/issues/24)
  - [ ] [Sismic](https://sismic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [ ] [SCXML](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/)
  - [ ] [WaveDrom](https://observablehq.com/@drom/wavedrom)
- Compile into other formats (hopefully, no promise):
  - [ ] WebAssembly (using [parity-wasm](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-wasm))
- Code generation 🤔
  - [ ] Julia via [`@generated`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#Generated-functions-1) implemented as [parametric](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/#Parametric-Methods-1) [multiple-dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia) [functors](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/#Function-like-objects-1)
  - [ ] Rust via [`#[proc_macro_attribute]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html#attribute-macros) implemented as [typestate programming](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/static-guarantees/typestate-programming.html)? (I'm still afraid if it will conflict with another crates)
  - [ ] Elixir via [`use`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/alias-require-and-import.html#use) macro which desugar into [gen_statem](https://andrealeopardi.com/posts/connection-managers-with-gen_statem/) 💪
  - [ ] Flutter via [`builder_factories`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Code-generation-in-Flutter) (waiting for the [FFI](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/34452) to be stable)
