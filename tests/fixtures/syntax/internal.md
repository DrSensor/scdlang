#### on exit
```scl

```
or
```scl
Alpha |> something
```
or
```scl
something <| Alpha
```
Read as: "execute *action **something*** when transition from *state **Alpha***"

```
or (discouraged)
```scl

```
or
```scl
Alpha <|> something
```
Read as: "when transition to/from *state **Alpha***, execute *action **something***"

#### action with expression
```scl
context VarX as x

state Alpha {
  entry |> --x
  exit |> ++x
}
```
Read as: "decrement `x` when entering *state **Alpha*** and increment `x` if exiting *state **Alpha***"

#### activity
```scl
state Beta { do |> beeping }
```
Read as: "perform *activity **beeping*** when on *state **Beta***"

#### internal transitions
> action on entry and exit will not be executed when those event triggered
```scl
state Beta { @ Click }

Read as: "*event **Click*** can occurred while in *state **Beta***"

##### with action
```scl
state Beta { @ Click |> something }
```
Read as: "execute *action **something*** when *event **Click*** occurred while in *state **Beta***"

##### with guard ðŸ¤”
